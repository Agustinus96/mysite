My first job out of college revolves around assisting multinational small-medium enterprises with hundreds of million US dollar in revenue. I was tasked in working as their 
corporate planner and served as a medium between the **local** and **Japanese** shareholders. I had to handle many things from secretarial type of jobs to higher-level management 
work - albeit for their smaller subsidiary in Indonesia. I was and am still eager to pick up new challenges and skills given the opportunity.

I worked on various projects, including being part of a stressful and bad oversea investment project. I learned a lot through the 3 and a half years experience of working there 
as a corporate planner for the head company and also working directly with the current CEO of the company. The difficulties of working in multiple level of a rather big SME came 
with a big learning opportunity. I was able to pick up skills on executives expectation management while also working on my communication skills when collaborating with people 
who work on the field.

Although I did not hold any official position in any of the subsidiaries if this company outside of being a corporate planned in the head office, I was very much involved with the activities and strategic planning of one of their indonesian subsidiary. Other than that, I was also directly involved in the recruitment of international employees until my resignation.
